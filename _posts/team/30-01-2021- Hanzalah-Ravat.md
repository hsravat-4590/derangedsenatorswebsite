Hi, I am Hanzalah and I'm currently in my second year of BSc Cyber Security at Aston. I am a systems engineer mainly working on the low-level components in the project notably leading the multiplayer development and integrating security features. In my free time, I like to tinker with Android AOSP source code and build customised versions.
