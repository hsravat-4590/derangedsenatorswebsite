The game will be developed using the Unity game engine. The reason for this choice is because of how effective Unity is, in terms of rendering 2D games and developing high quality cross-platform games, this enables us to compile and use a single script for different platforms. Its ease of use and vast features available such as its interactive UI and its editor speed, makes Unity a powerful and great game development engine. Unity comes with Visual Studio support which allows us to write the game scripts using C# programming language, which consists of good integrity, simplicity, and fast speed.
